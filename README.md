# Data Structures in C

This repository contains header files implementing four common data structures in the C programming language: Linked List, Queue, Stack, and Binary Tree. These header files can be included in your C projects to utilize these data structures.

## Linked List

The Linked List data structure is implemented in the [`linkedlist.h`](linkedlist.h) header file. It provides functions for creating, inserting, deleting, and traversing singly linked lists.

## Queue

The Queue data structure is implemented in the [`queue.h`](queue.h) header file. It provides functions for creating a queue, enqueueing elements, dequeueing elements, and checking the queue's emptiness or size.

## Stack

The Stack data structure is implemented in the [`stack.h`](stack.h) header file. It provides functions for creating a stack, pushing elements onto the stack, popping elements from the stack, and checking if the stack is empty.

## Binary Tree

The Binary Tree data structure is implemented in the [`bintree.h`](bintree.h) header file. It provides functions for creating a binary tree, inserting nodes, traversing the tree (in-order, pre-order, post-order), and searching for nodes.

## Usage

To use these data structures in your C projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Include the desired header file(s) in your C code:

```c
#include "linkedlist.h"
#include "queue.h"
#include "stack.h"
#include "bintree.h"
```

3. Utilize the functions provided by each data structure as needed in your code.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this repository, feel free to open a pull request. You can contribute by adding new features, fixing bugs, improving documentation, or enhancing the implementations of the data structures.

Please follow the established coding style and ensure that your code changes are well-tested.
